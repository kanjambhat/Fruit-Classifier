# Fruit-Classifier
A CNN based model for differentiating among 131 different classes of fruits.

Here, I've used CNN as a way to classify among 131 different types of fruits. With 4 layers of concolution and a single dense layer followed by an output layer, the model classifies the fruits upto an accuracy of 97% for the training set and 97% for the validation set.
